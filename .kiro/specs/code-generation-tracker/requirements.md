# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Code Generation Tracker is a graphical application that monitors and visualizes developers' code generation activities over time. The application will track key metrics including lines of code committed, lines removed, and calculate ratios such as lines per file. The system will initially use snapshot data from git repositories to provide insights into coding patterns and productivity trends, with the flexibility to support various data sources beyond GitHub in the future.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a development manager, I want to view code generation metrics for team members, so that I can understand productivity patterns and identify trends over time.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application loads THEN the system SHALL display a list of all tracked developers
2. WHEN a user selects a developer THEN the system SHALL show their code generation metrics including lines added, lines removed, and files modified
3. WHEN viewing metrics THEN the system SHALL display data in a time-series format showing changes over time
4. IF no data exists for a developer THEN the system SHALL display an appropriate empty state message

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to see my lines per file ratio, so that I can understand if I'm writing concise or verbose code.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing developer metrics THEN the system SHALL calculate and display the lines per file ratio
2. WHEN the ratio is calculated THEN the system SHALL use total lines of code divided by total number of files
3. WHEN displaying the ratio THEN the system SHALL show it as a decimal number rounded to two decimal places
4. IF a developer has no files THEN the system SHALL display the ratio as 0 or "N/A"

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a team lead, I want to import git repository snapshot data, so that I can populate the application with real code generation metrics.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN importing snapshot data THEN the system SHALL accept git repository data in a standardized format
2. WHEN processing snapshot data THEN the system SHALL extract developer names, commit dates, lines added, lines removed, and file counts
3. WHEN data is imported THEN the system SHALL store it in a way that supports time-series analysis
4. IF import data is malformed THEN the system SHALL display clear error messages and continue processing valid entries

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want to view code generation data through an intuitive graphical interface, so that I can easily understand and analyze the metrics.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application starts THEN the system SHALL display a clean, responsive graphical user interface
2. WHEN viewing metrics THEN the system SHALL present data using charts, graphs, or visual representations
3. WHEN interacting with the interface THEN the system SHALL provide smooth navigation between different views and developers
4. WHEN displaying time-series data THEN the system SHALL allow users to filter or zoom into specific time periods

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the application to work with dummy data initially, so that I can see how the interface works before connecting real data sources.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application first runs THEN the system SHALL include pre-populated dummy data for demonstration
2. WHEN using dummy data THEN the system SHALL include multiple developers with varied metrics over different time periods
3. WHEN displaying dummy data THEN the system SHALL clearly indicate that it is sample data
4. WHEN dummy data is present THEN the system SHALL demonstrate all key features including metrics calculation and visualization

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a product owner, I want the system to be data-source agnostic, so that we can integrate with different version control systems beyond GitHub in the future.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN designing the data layer THEN the system SHALL use abstract interfaces that don't depend on specific git providers
2. WHEN processing data THEN the system SHALL work with standardized data formats rather than provider-specific APIs
3. WHEN adding new data sources THEN the system SHALL require minimal changes to core application logic
4. IF switching data sources THEN the system SHALL maintain all existing functionality and user experience
